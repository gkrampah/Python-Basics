# Problem solving through programming

The process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills

Python is an example of a high-level language; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C++, PHP, Pascal, C#, and Java. There are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be translated into something more suitable before they can run. 

#### why programme with high-level languages?

It is much easier to program in a high-level language so programs take less time to write and easier to read. They are shorter and are more likely to be correct. Secondly, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications.

The engine that translates and runs Python is called the Python Interpreter which can be use in two ways; immediate mode or script mode

#### what is a program?
A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.

A computer program is a sequence of instructions that a computer can execute to perform some task or solve a particular problem. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a formal language designed to communicate algorithms and processes to a computer in a way that is both executable and human-readable.

A computer program typically performs a series of operations or calculations based on input data, manipulates this data according to specified rules, and then produces output data. The program may also interact with various hardware components (e.g., the processor, memory, input/output devices) and software components (e.g., operating systems, libraries) of a computer system.

Computer programs can be as simple as a few lines of code that add two numbers together or as complex as entire operating systems, database management systems, or advanced scientific simulations.

Programs generally consist of the following basic elements:

* Variables: Containers that hold data values.
* Data Types: Specify the kind of data (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc.) that can be stored in variables.
* Operators: Symbols that perform operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) on variables and values.
* Control Structures: Mechanisms for directing the flow of execution (e.g., loops, conditional statements).
* Functions/Procedures: Modular blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks.
* Input/Output: Mechanisms for receiving data from and sending data to the external world (e.g., keyboard, mouse, files, network).
* Comments: Non-executable lines that are used to describe what the code is doing.
